# AI-Driven-Automated-API-testing-Tool
AI Driven Automated API Testing Tool with CI/CD and GitHub Integration Develop a tool for API test generation, execution, and reporting, enhanced by AI/ML. Web-based UI for uploading API request URLs individually or in bulk. Include fields for parameters, headers, payloads, and authentication. Automatically generate positive, negative, and boundary test cases from API details. Use AI for dynamic data generation to simulate realistic scenarios. Execute tests asynchronously with support for parallel API executions. Implement self-healing scripts using ML to detect and adjust for API schema changes. Generate HTML/PDF reports summarizing test results (passed/failed, response metrics). Apply AI for anomaly detection and error clustering in test outcomes. Export generated test scripts to GitHub for CI/CD pipeline integration. Automate version control with commits for generated tests. Optional scheduling for test runs and environment-specific configurations. Send email notifications with summarized test results. Suggested tech stack: React/Vue, Node.js/Python, Cypress/Postman/JUnit, Hugging Face for NLP, Scikit-Learn for anomaly detection, GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration.
------------------
Creating an AI-driven automated API testing tool involves multiple components, including a web-based UI, backend logic for test generation and execution, and integration with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions. Below is a structured approach to developing such a tool using Python for the backend and a modern JavaScript framework for the frontend.
Project Overview

Key Features:

    Web-Based UI: For API input, including parameters, headers, payloads, and authentication.
    AI-Driven Test Generation: Automatically create positive, negative, and boundary test cases.
    Asynchronous Test Execution: Support for parallel API executions.
    Self-Healing Scripts: Machine learning to adjust for API schema changes.
    Reporting: Generate HTML/PDF reports summarizing test results.
    Integration with GitHub: Export test scripts and automate version control.

Step 1: Backend Implementation (Python with Flask)

Here's a simplified backend structure using Flask:
1.1 Install Required Libraries

bash

pip install Flask requests pandas Flask-Mail

1.2 Flask API Structure

python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests
import pandas as pd
from flask_mail import Mail, Message
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure email (for notifications)
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp.example.com'
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your_email@example.com'
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_password'
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
app.config['MAIL_USE_SSL'] = False
mail = Mail(app)

@app.route('/upload-api', methods=['POST'])
def upload_api():
    api_data = request.json
    # Logic for processing the API data and generating tests
    # Call function to generate tests
    results = generate_tests(api_data)
    return jsonify(results)

def generate_tests(api_data):
    # Logic for generating test cases using AI/ML
    # For simplicity, just returning a placeholder response
    return {"status": "Tests generated", "tests": []}

@app.route('/send-report', methods=['POST'])
def send_report():
    report_data = request.json
    recipient = report_data.get('recipient')
    subject = report_data.get('subject')
    body = report_data.get('body')
    
    msg = Message(subject, sender='your_email@example.com', recipients=[recipient])
    msg.body = body
    mail.send(msg)
    return jsonify({"status": "Report sent"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 2: Frontend Implementation (React/Vue)
2.1 Setting Up React App

You can create a new React application using Create React App:

bash

npx create-react-app api-testing-tool
cd api-testing-tool
npm start

2.2 Basic Component Structure

Hereâ€™s a simple component to upload API data:

jsx

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function ApiUpload() {
    const [apiData, setApiData] = useState({});

    const handleChange = (e) => {
        setApiData({ ...apiData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
    };

    const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/upload-api', apiData);
        console.log(response.data);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input type="text" name="url" onChange={handleChange} placeholder="API URL" required />
            <input type="text" name="headers" onChange={handleChange} placeholder="Headers" />
            <textarea name="payload" onChange={handleChange} placeholder="Payload"></textarea>
            <button type="submit">Upload API</button>
        </form>
    );
}

export default ApiUpload;

Step 3: CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions

Create a GitHub Action to automate test execution:

yaml

name: API Testing

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python -m unittest discover tests

Step 4: Reporting and Anomaly Detection

For generating reports, you can use libraries like pandas and reportlab to create PDFs. Anomaly detection can be implemented using scikit-learn or similar libraries to analyze test results and cluster errors.
Final Notes

    AI Integration: For AI-driven features like dynamic data generation or test case generation, consider using NLP models from Hugging Face or OpenAI API.
    Self-Healing Mechanism: Implement logic to parse API schema changes and adjust tests accordingly using ML techniques.
    Email Notifications: The provided example includes a simple email notification setup; customize it according to your needs.
    Deployment: Consider deploying your Flask app on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for public access.

This is a high-level overview and starting point for developing your API testing tool. Each section can be expanded with more specific functionalities based on your requirements.
